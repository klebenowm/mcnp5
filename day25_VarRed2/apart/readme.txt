The original run has no tally results.
Exponential transform of 0.5 was not very effective.
Exponential transform of 0.9 was very effective for FOM,
    but the tally results yield only answers in the cosine=1 bin.
Exponential transform of 0.65 with weight windows and more histories
    yields better results but with a much lower FOM.
